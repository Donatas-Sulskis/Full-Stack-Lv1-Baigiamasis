      Cindy Stout — Web Designer & Developer
    </h2>
    <p class="about-main-container1-p">
      After graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor’s Degree (First Class
      Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last nine
      years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as
      part of a team in various companies across Galway, Dublin, Berlin and
      Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as
      the ability to communicate <br />with team members and clients while
      effectively meeting milestones and deadlines. <br />
      <br />
      As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several
      graphic designers in Berlin and Melbourne, at the same time
      maintaining clients in Germany, Ireland, Australia and the UK. <br />
      <br />
      I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a
      range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator,
      InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery,
      WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce
      Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design. During my Multimedia
      degree I studied Information Architecture, and therefore have a keen
      understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which
      I put to good use on every project I work on. <br />
      <br />
      I am currently working in Ireland between Dublin and Galway. I am
      always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype.
      These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike, baking and
      crocheting.

      John Doe — Photographer, Copywriter & Translator
    </h2>
    <p class="about-main-container1-p">
      Since turning my passion into a career, I’ve worked as a professional
      photographer in Germany, Australia and Ireland. I’ve received numerous
      awards and my photographs have appeared in various galleries across
      the globe. They’re also found in publications such as Time Magazine,
      The Sydney Morning Herald Newspaper, Australian Geographic, and on the
      cover of Tasmania 40° South Magazine. My fine art prints appear in the
      University of Melbourne’s collection and in various private homes and
      institutions across Australia, Europe, and the United States. <br />
      <br />
      I’ve worked together with Emily for a number of years now. Apart from
      conducting photo shoots for her websites, I also collaborate regularly
      with Emily to provide clear and succinct content writing. In addition,
      I provide the full gamut of SEO services, including not only content,
      image and website structure optimisation, but also regular
      maintenance, Google Analytics reporting, and the creation and
      management of Google AdWords campaigns. <br />
      <br />
      I also provide German translating and interpreting. I’m fluent in
      German, having lived in Berlin for three years, and I regularly
      translate entire websites for various translation clients and
      localisation and IT companies around the world. <br />
      <br />
      My eye for detail, creative view on the world, and meticulous nature
      have left me with many highly satisfied clients. I look forward to
      speaking with you soon about your unique project, be it photography,
      copywriting, SEO or translation!
