            What is WordPress?
          </h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            WordPress is a content management system (CMS). A CMS is
            computer software that allows publishing, editing and organising
            content such as text, photos, video etc. from an administrative
            screen. Therefore, WordPress allows you to have full control
            over your website’s content without having to look at any of the
            code.
          </p>
          <h2 class="accordion-h2">Themes</h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            A WordPress theme defines the style, colours, layout, fonts and
            all other graphical content on your website.
          </p>
          <h2 class="accordion-h2">Plugins</h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            WordPress plugins are used to extend your website and add in
            additional functionality. An example of this would be adding in
            a contact form or photo gallery to your website. Plugins are
            also used to incorporate better search engine optimization (SEO)
            or to add extra security to your website.
          </p>
          <h2 class="accordion-h2">Widgets</h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            WordPress widgets are used to add content and extra features to
            your website’s sidebar, footer or header (depending on the theme
            you are using). An example of a widget could be a list of
            categories, a tag cloud, a Facebook feed etc.

            Domain Name / Web Address
          </h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            Each website has a unique domain name to identify it from the
            rest. For example, the domain name of this website is
            www.emilyridge.ie. Domain names are also sometimes called ‘web
            addresses’ or ‘URLs’. Having a unique domain name for your
            company allows your audience to search for your website through
            Google or type it manually in your browser’s search bar. In
            order to obtain a domain name for your company, you will need to
            contact a hosting company who will set everything up for you.
          </p>
          <h2 class="accordion-h2">Hosting Package</h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            Once you have obtained your domain name, you will need to
            purchase a hosting package. A website host or server is a space
            on the internet in which we can put your website’s files so that
            it will be visible to the public. It’s similar to having a
            folder on your computer’s desktop with files inside. A website
            host is simply a folder on your hosting company’s online server
            which contains your website’s files and makes them visible to
            the public.
          </p>
          <h2 class="accordion-h2">Recommended Hosting Packages</h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            Most websites will work perfectly on Blacknight’s Minimus
            (Linux) hosting plan. If you do not have a hosting package I
            would recommend that you go with Blacknight as they have
            excellent customer support and there are never any issues with
            them.

          <p class="accordion-p">
            Without a doubt, keeping an up-to-date backup of all of your
            website’s files, content and database is the safest way to
            ensure that your website will always be safe. No matter what
            happens you will always have a saved version of the website to
            pop back up online at any time. We usually recommend that all of
            the website’s content is backed up every 2 – 4 weeks based on
            how often new content is added.

            Updating your website’s WordPress version
          </h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            WordPress sporadically releases version updates and it’s
            important that your website is always using the latest version.
            Most of the time the version updates are simply to increase
            security and remove any vulnerabilities. It’s vital to ensure
            you have a complete backup of your website files, content and
            database before preforming a WordPress version update.

          </h2>
          <p class="accordion-p">
            WordPress plugins are coded files which extend the basic
            functionality of WordPress. An example could be a plugin that
            adds a contact form to your website. Plugins are often written
            by external developers and are released to the public for use
            through the WordPress Plugin Directory. Using plugins in custom
            WordPress websites is common practice amongst website developers
            and rarely cause problems as long as they are maintained and
            kept up-to-date.
